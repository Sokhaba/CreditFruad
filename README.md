# Credit Fraud Detection #
This repository contains code for building a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using Python and various data science libraries.

## Dataset ##
The dataset used in this project is the __Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset__ from Kaggle. It contains over 280,000 credit card transactions, with approximately 0.17% of them being fraudulent. The dataset is highly imbalanced, making it a challenging problem to solve.
